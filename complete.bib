  abstract = {Escherichia coli bacteria are the most common causes of diarrhea and septicemia in calves. Moreover, calves form a major reservoir for transmission of pathogenic E. coli to humans. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of publications on E. coli as calf pathogens and the role of calves as reservoir have not been done so far. We reviewed studies between 1951 and 2013 reporting the presence of virulence associated factors (VAFs) in calf E. coli and extracted the following information: year(s) and country of sampling, animal number, health status, isolate number, VAF prevalence, serotypes, diagnostic methods, and biological assays. The prevalence of VAFs or E. coli pathotypes was compared between healthy and diarrheic animals and was analyzed for time courses. Together, 106 papers with 25,982 E. coli isolates from 27 countries tested for VAFs were included. F5, F17, and F41 fimbriae and heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) - VAFs of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were significantly associated with calf diarrhea. On the contrary, ETEC VAF F4 fimbriae and heat-labile enterotoxin as well as enteropathogenic (EPEC), Shiga toxin-producing (STEC), and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) were not associated with diarrhea. The prevalence increased overtime for ST-positive isolates, but decreased for F5- and STEC-positive isolates. Our study provides useful information about the history of scientific investigations performed in this domain so far, and helps to define etiological agents of calf disease, and to evaluate calves as reservoir hosts for human pathogenic E. coli.},

  abstract = {The estimated mean copy per partition ({$\lambda$}) is the essential information from a digital PCR (dPCR) experiment because {$\lambda$} can be used to calculate the target concentration in a sample. However, little information is available how to statistically compare dPCR runs of multiple runs or reduplicates. The comparison of {$\lambda$} values from several runs is a multiple comparison problem, which can be solved using the binary structure of dPCR data. We propose and evaluate two novel methods based on Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Multiple Ratio Tests (MRT) for comparison of digital PCR experiments. We enriched our MRT framework with computation of simultaneous confidence intervals suitable for comparing multiple dPCR runs. The evaluation of both statistical methods support that MRT is faster and more robust for dPCR experiments performed in large scale. Our theoretical results were confirmed by the analysis of dPCR measurements of dilution series. Both methods were implemented in the dpcR package (v. 0.2) for the open source R statistical computing environment.},

  issn = {0099-2240, 1098-5336},
  abstract = {Bacterial biofilm formation is a widespread phenomenon and a complex process requiring a set of genes facilitating the initial adhesion, maturation, production of extracellular polymeric matrix (EPS) and subsequent dispersal of bacteria. Most studies on Escherichia coli (E. coli) biofilm formation have investigated non-pathogenic E. coli K-12 strains. Due to the extensive focus on laboratory strains in most studies, there is poor information regarding biofilm formation by pathogenic E. coli isolates. In this study, we genotypically and phenotypically characterized 187 human clinical E. coli isolates representing various pathotypes (e.g., uropathogenic, enteropathogenic and enteroaggregative E. coli). We investigated the presence of biofilm-associated genes (``genotype'') and phenotypically analyzed the isolates for motility, curli and cellulose production (``phenotype''). We developed a new screening method to examine the in vitro biofilm formation ability. In summary, we found a high prevalence of biofilm-associated genes. However, we could not detect a biofilm-associated gene or specific phenotype correlating with the biofilm formation ability. In contrast, we could identify an association of increased biofilm formation with a specific E. coli pathotype. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) were found to exhibit the highest capacity of biofilm formation. Using our image-based technology for the screening of biofilm formation, we have demonstrated the characteristic biofilm formation pattern of EAEC, consisting of thick bacterial aggregates. In summary, our results highlight the fact that biofilm-promoting factors shown to be critical for biofilm formation in non-pathogenic strains do not reflect their impact in clinical isolates and that the ability of biofilm formation is a defined characteristic for EAEC.
IMPORTANCE Bacterial biofilms are ubiquitous and consist of sessile bacterial cells surrounded by a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix. They cause chronic and device-related infections due to their high resistance to antibiotics and the host immune system. In non-pathogenic E. coli cell surface components playing a pivotal role in biofilm formation are well known. In contrast, there is poor information for their role in biofilm formation of pathogenic isolates. Our study provides insights into the correlation of biofilm-associated genes or specific phenotypes with the biofilm formation ability of commensal and pathogenic E. coli. Additionally, we represent a new developed method enabling qualitative biofilm analysis by automated image analysis which is beneficial for high-throughput screenings. Our results help to establish a better understanding of E. coli biofilm formation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantification cycle (Cq) and amplification efficiency (AE) are parameters mathematically extracted from raw data to characterize quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions and quantify the copy number in a sample. Little attention has been paid to the effects of preprocessing and the use of smoothing or filtering approaches to compensate for noisy data. Existing algorithms largely are taken for granted, and it is unclear which of the various methods is most informative. We investigated the effect of smoothing and filtering algorithms on amplification curve data.
METHODS: We obtained published high-replicate qPCR data sets from standard block thermocyclers and other cycler platforms and statistically evaluated the impact of smoothing on Cq and AE.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that selected smoothing algorithms affect estimates of Cq and AE considerably. The commonly used moving average filter performed worst in all qPCR scenarios. The Savitzky\textendash{}Golay smoother, cubic splines, and Whittaker smoother resulted overall in the least bias in our setting and exhibited low sensitivity to differences in qPCR AE, whereas other smoothers, such as running mean, introduced an AE-dependent bias.
CONCLUSIONS: The selection of a smoothing algorithm is an important step in developing data analysis pipelines for real-time PCR experiments. We offer guidelines for selection of an appropriate smoothing algorithm in diagnostic qPCR applications. The findings of our study were implemented in the R packages chipPCR and qpcR as a basis for the implementation of an analytical strategy.},

  abstract = {Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data are found to display periodic patterns in the fluorescence intensity as a function of sample number for fixed cycle number. This behavior is seen for technical replicate datasets recorded on several different commercial instruments; it occurs in the baseline region and typically increases with increasing cycle number in the growth and plateau regions. Autocorrelation analysis reveals periodicities of 12 for 96-well systems and 24 for a 384-well system, indicating a correlation with block architecture. Passive dye experiments show that the effect may be from optical detector bias. Importantly, the signal periodicity manifests as periodicity in quantification cycle (Cq) values when these are estimated by the widely applied fixed threshold approach, but not when scale-insensitive markers like first- and second-derivative maxima are used. Accordingly, any scale variability in the growth curves will lead to bias in constant-threshold-based Cqs, making it mandatory that workers should either use scale-insensitive Cqs or normalize their growth curves to constant amplitude before applying the constant threshold method.},

  abstract = {Amyloids are proteins associated with several clinical disorders, including Alzheimer's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob's. Despite their diversity, all amyloid proteins can undergo aggregation initiated by short segments called hot spots. To find the patterns defining the hot spots, we trained predictors of amyloidogenicity, using n-grams and random forest classifiers. Since the amyloidogenicity may not depend on the exact sequence of amino acids but on their more general properties, we tested 524,284 reduced amino acid alphabets of different lengths (three to six letters) to find the alphabet providing the best performance in cross-validation. The predictor based on this alphabet, called AmyloGram, was benchmarked against the most popular tools for the detection of amyloid peptides using an external data set and obtained the highest values of performance measures (AUC: 0.90, MCC: 0.63). Our results showed sequential patterns in the amyloids which are strongly correlated with hydrophobicity, a tendency to form {$\beta$}-sheets, and lower flexibility of amino acid residues. Among the most informative n-grams of AmyloGram we identified 15 that were previously confirmed experimentally. AmyloGram is available as the web-server: http://smorfland.uni.wroc.pl/shiny/AmyloGram/ and as the R package AmyloGram.

  abstract = {Signal peptides are N-terminal presequences responsible for targeting proteins to the endomembrane system, and subsequent subcellular or extracellular compartments, and consequently condition their proper function. The significance of signal peptides stimulates development of new computational methods for their detection. These methods employ learning systems trained on datasets comprising signal peptides from different types of proteins and taxonomic groups. As a result, the accuracy of predictions are high in the case of signal peptides that are well-represented in databases, but might be low in other, atypical cases. Such atypical signal peptides are present in proteins found in apicomplexan parasites, causative agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis. Apicomplexan proteins have a unique amino acid composition due to their AT-biased genomes. Therefore, we designed a new, more flexible and universal probabilistic model for recognition of atypical eukaryotic signal peptides. Our approach called signalHsmm includes knowledge about the structure of signal peptides and physicochemical properties of amino acids. It is able to recognize signal peptides from the malaria parasites and related species more accurately than popular programs. Moreover, it is still universal enough to provide prediction of other signal peptides on par with the best preforming predictors.},

Salmonella serotypes are differentiated into host-restricted and host-adapted specialists, and host-unrestricted generalists. In order to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of host specificity in Salmonella infection, we investigated the role of the intestinal host cell receptor zymogen granule membrane glycoprotein 2 (GP2), which is recognized by FimH adhesin of type 1 fimbriae found in Enterobacteriaceae. We compared four human and two porcine GP2 isoforms. Isoforms were expressed in Sf9 cells as well as in one human (HEp-2) and one porcine (IPEC-J2) cell line. FimH genes of 128 Salmonella isolates were sequenced and the 10 identified FimH variants were compared regarding adhesion (static adhesion assay) and infection (cell line assay) using an isogenic model. We expressed and characterized two functional porcine GP2 isoforms differing in their amino acid sequence to human isoforms by approximately 25\%. By comparing all isoforms in the static adhesion assay, FimH variants were assigned to high, low or no-binding phenotypes. This FimH variant-dependent binding was neither specific for one GP2 isoform nor for GP2 in general. However, cell line infection assays revealed fundamental differences: using HEp-2 cells, infection was also FimH variant-specific but mainly independent of human GP2. In contrast, this FimH variant dependency was not obvious using IPEC-J2 cells. Here, we propose an alternative GP2 adhesion/infection mechanism whereby porcine GP2 is not a receptor that determined host-specificity of Salmonella. Salmonella specialists as well as generalists demonstrated similar binding to GP2. Future studies should focus on spatial distribution of GP2 isoforms in the human and porcine intestine, especially comparing health and disease.},

They can roughly be divided into a ground or baseline phase, an exponential amplification phase, a linear phase and finally a plateau phase, where in the latter, the PCR product concentration no longer increases. Nevertheless, in some cases the plateau phase displays a negative trend, e.g. in hydrolysis probe assays. This cycle-to-cycle fluorescence decrease is commonly referred to in the literature as the hook effect. Other detection chemistries also exhibit this negative trend, however the underlying molecular mechanisms are different. In this study we present two approaches to automatically detect hook effect-like curvatures based on linear (hookreg) and nonlinear regression (hookregNL). As the hook effect is typical for qPCR data, both algorithms can be employed for the automated identification of regular structured qPCR curves. Therefore, our algorithms streamline quality control, but can also be used for assay optimization or machine learning.},
